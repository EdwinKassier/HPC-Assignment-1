# HPC-Assignment-1
High Performance Computing assignment using OpenMP and MPI


The brief for this assignment was to implement a Quicksort and Parallel Regular Sampling Sort in both OpenMP and MPI, thereafter performing validation on their outputs and then benchmarking their performance to explore and showcase the difference in algorithms and the methods used to parallelise them. Additionally, it was requested to create a serial quicksort class to showcase the difference between the serial version and its parallelised OpenMP and MPI versions and the enhanced quicksort Parallel Regular Sampling Sort.
